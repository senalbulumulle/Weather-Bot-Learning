Learning how to build a chatbot using Rasa. This is for UNF ARIO. 

I am using Rasa X, instead of Rasa Core. I am using this on a virtual machine running on Ubuntu 20.04.1. I also created a shell script that
helps the installation of the dependencies and packages that are required for Rasa. If there are 
any additions, or changes on this learning repository, please let me know. The configuration script is located
in the "dependencies.sh" file.

### Dependencies required to install and run Rasa
Run the dependencies.sh installer and sit back and relax.
```sh
sh dependencies.sh
```
